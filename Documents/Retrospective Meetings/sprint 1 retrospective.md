# SPRINT 1 RETROSPECTIVE MEETING

DATE: 11 May 2023

## Minutes:

###  Initial goals for sprint 1:

-  A basic login page 

-  A basic view of a dashboard for both the student and the lecturer

-  A view of a calendar on the dashboards with the ability to navigate through the calendar. 

-  Sprint 1 is set to be due on Thursday 11/05/2023

-  The node application is to be deployed to Azure.

###  Actual outcome of sprint 1:

-  A basic login page is viewable where the login button redirects the user to the student dashboard.

-  The login page is not fully functional as no database is in place yet

-  A lecturer dashboard exists. However, there's no link to it. It can only be accessed by editing the url path.

-  A calendar can be viewed and navigated through on both the student's and lectuerer's dashboard. 

###  Reasons for  the outcomes of sprint 1:

-  We did not allocate enough time to creating a database in order to create a fully functional login page

###  What could have been done to improve the sprint 1 release:

-  A database should be created to implement full functionality of the login page

-  The login page should be able to differentiate between a student and lecturer to redirect the user to their respective page.

-  Using bootstrap library and incorporating more CSS to provide a better looking UI

-  An about page can be added to provide details on the author as well as the release number of the application

###  How did the team work together?

-  The team worked well together. However, improvements can be made on getting more tasks done effeiciently.

# Retrospective

## What the team did well:

-  Most functionality of the golas set out for sprint 1 was completed.

-  All members created separate branches as they worked on their assigned user story.

-  All members were able to review at least one pull request.

-  The assigned taks were completed by the corresponding person successfully. 

## What went wrong:

-  The overall web application is very simple with not much functionality specific to the use of the application

-  The UI is not particulary pleasing to the eye.

-  No tests were done for the code produced in the first sprint.

## What could be improved:

-  Better time management.

-  Create developer sized stories to improve efficiency with task allocation.

-  Creating tests for each issue.

## Approach for Sprint 2:

-  The scrumboard and USM is updated at the very beginning of the new sprint.

-  Equally split the tasks amongst the team members.

-  Communicate when issues arise so that the group can make decisions together on how to solve the problem

-  Aim to integrate each member's task by the morning of 18 May to ensure enough time to deal with any problems so that the 2nd release can be done on time.

-  Ensure all documentation required for the end of sprint 2 is completed on time.

## Sprint velocity achieved for sprint 1:

-  Formula:

   `Sum of all story points / no. of sprints`
   
   `= (2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 4) / 1`
   
   `= 14`
